# Broadband Access in the United States

Author: Renata Gerecke

Date: 2021-07

The purpose of this project is to explore who has access to high speed internet access as reported to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) by Internet Service Providers.

## Current Progress

I have mapped from 2016-2020 what percentage of residents have access to 25 and 100 mbps internet from 2 or more ISPs.

## Future Goals

I would like to:

- Turn the existing maps into GIFs showing internet access expansion over time
- Merge census demographic data to approximate access by race and income
- Compare this data with Microsoft's data measuring what internet access people actually have
